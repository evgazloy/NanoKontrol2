## Hey there!
# NanoKontrol2 Ableton Live Remote Script

This script is a stripped down version of the code found in [this Ableton forum article](https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=193316)

I couldn't find the original repository to fork so created a new one to probably mod based on what I like or my experience of using the nanoKontrol 2 along with the script. 

Figured other folks would like to have a second source for the code or may have good ideas but no coding experience, or just would love to contribute. 

### Notes :
 
 * I use this script on Live 9.1 so not sure about its compatibility with other versions but I believe it's supposed to support as early as 8.

 * I'm trying to set up a default Ableton track with some effects already dropped in the default MIDI and Audio tracks. So some [future] features might not be portable to all settings. 

 * I disabled most of the scene control and highlighting stuff because I found it a bit far-fetched for that foot print to control your clips but more importantly because I own a Launchpad so I didn't need it

 * I ended up getting entirely rid of the initial mode and just default to shift mode

 * I changed the "mode" buttons to just enable the modes because the toggle wouldn't stay on and I found it easier to just enable a mode I want to use. I have more to learn about this stuff so feel free to let me know if there's a better way of doing things. 

 * If you've had pain points with the original or my script, let me know!
